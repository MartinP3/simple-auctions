## Simple Auctions

Not my proudest work whatsoever.
Simple Auctions is a _drumroll_ auction site! you can list items you wish to sell and bid on things you want with 1000 free credits!

## Installation guide

You do not need anything to simply view the site locally, simply clone the repository and it'll work as intended.
But if you wish to work in the same environment I did you must:

- npm i

- npm run build

# to install the dependencies.

## Dependencies

- Bootstrap
- Sass

## DevDependencies

- Prettier
- ESlint
- Husky
- Lint-staged
